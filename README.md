## Best Practices Implementation

**1. Environment Variables:**
- Why did we put `BASE_URI` in `.env` instead of hardcoding it?  
- **Answer:** Storing `BASE_URI` in `.env` makes the application more secure and flexible. It prevents sensitive or environment-specific values from being exposed in the codebase, allows easy configuration changes without modifying source code, and supports different environments (development, staging, production) seamlessly.


**2. Resource Modeling:**
- Why did we use plural nouns (e.g., `/dishes`) for our routes?  
- **Answer:** RESTful conventions recommend using plural nouns to represent collections of resources. For example, `/dishes` represents the entire set of dish resources, while `/dishes/{id}` refers to a single resource. This improves clarity, consistency, and aligns with widely accepted API design standards.

**3. Status Codes:**
- When do we use `201 Created` vs `200 OK`?  
- **Answer:**  
  - `201 Created` is used when a new resource has been successfully created (e.g., after a POST request).  
  - `200 OK` is used when a request succeeds but does not involve creating a new resource (e.g., GET or successful PUT).  

- Why is it important to return `404` instead of just an empty array or a generic error?  
- **Answer:** Returning `404 Not Found` clearly communicates that the requested resource does not exist. An empty array or generic error could mislead clients into thinking the request was valid but returned no data. Proper status codes improve API usability, debugging, and adherence to HTTP standards.
